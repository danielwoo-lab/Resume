        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Daniel and I am a part of the public health administration team. As a current public health administrator my roles are to manage all aspects of the public health organization, which include the oversight of budgets, programs, staff, and grants, among many others. Job duties of public health administrators include assessing community health issues, educating the public on the prevention or alleviation of health problems, executing community outreach programs, addressing chronic problems afflicting a specific community or population, writing grant proposals and heading up fundraising efforts and balancing limited budgets and allocating funds where needed. Public health administration is firmly rooted in business management; therefore, public health administrators must plan programs as if they were business ventures, focusing on performance, innovation, negotiation, and customer service. In public health organizations with shrinking budgets, public health administrators must take on more work with less staff, making this my healthcare position one of substantial importance to the organizationâ€™s continued operations. National health care reform legislation has further changed the way public health organizations operate and receive funding, which adds an additional layer of complexity to an already-complex system.My role within health administrators often varies depending on the organization I would currently be working for at the time. However, all of the various fields public health administrators are a part of work to improve the quality of public health services, which includes understanding the legal, political, and economic climate in which their organizations develop, implement, and improve upon programs. For example, changes in the political and/or economic forces within a community or population may greatly affect how a public health program functions. Public health administrators must be able to deftly modify, alter, or amend their programs to meet these changes.

<br><br>

        I embody many of these following ideals. 
Self Confidence â€“ Itâ€™s important for a public health administrator to have the confidence needed to make decisions and defend them as needed.
Devotion â€“ In most cases, public health administrators work at least 5 days a week and often much longer. As a result, devotion to the job is important.
Good Problem Solving Skills â€“ In administration, problems pop up regularly. Whether itâ€™s balancing a budget or tackling a health crisis, an administrator must be able to overcome problems quickly.
Strong Writing Skills â€“ Administrators spend a good deal of time developing reports and policies. Good writing skills are a must.
Good Public Speaking Skills â€“ Additionally, reports and information are often discussed in public settings. A strong public speaking skill is important as well.
 

<br><br>

       Public health administrators focus on community-wide disease prevention and health promotion. As the name of the profession shows, there are two parts to their jobs. Public health administrators try to improve the welfare of the community at large and run the organizations that disseminate information about health. The majority are employed by governmental health agencies, while others work for not-for-profit organizations and educational institutions. They assess community health issues and educate members about the prevention or alleviation of health problems. The public health administrator executes community outreach programs to make people aware of dangers such as lead poisoning and to address chronic problems afflicting the community, like sexually transmitted diseases.
